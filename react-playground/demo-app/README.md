# React Playground - Demo App

Bootstrapped using [base-setup](https://github.com/emptymusings/Miscellaneous/tree/main/react-playground/base-setup)

## Demo App

This is just a playground set up to explore React customizations and offer a playground. It may be able to be bootstrapped to launch other effors.

It uses **webpack 5**, **babel**, **react-router 6**, **mui 5**, **eslint**, **prettier**, **husky**.

Following [this guide](https://scottsauber.com/2021/06/01/using-husky-git-hooks-and-lint-staged-with-nested-folders/) helped significantly in setting up **husky** to run from a subdirectory of the main `git` project location (husky prefers to install from the `git` root directory).

## Resources
- [MUI 5](https://mui.com/)
- [ESLint](https://www.carlrippon.com/creating-react-app-with-typescript-eslint-with-webpack5/)
- [Prettier - Official](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html) - **NOTE** - husky/lint-staged are not applied in this project, and should be added to any bootstrapped effort if [Git Hooks](https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html#git-hooks) are desired
